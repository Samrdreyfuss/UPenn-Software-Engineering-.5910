        type is the key and the value is an Expense object with the parameters expense type and total amount for that
        expense type.

        The same expense type may appear multiple times in the given file, so add all the amounts for the same
        expense types.

        Ignore expenses with missing amounts. If a line contains both an expense type and an expense amount,
        they will be separated by a colon (:).

        You can assume that if they exist, expense types are one-word strings and the amounts are numerical and can
        be casted to a float data type.

        Strip any whitespace before or after the expense types and amounts. Blank lines should be ignored.

        Expenses are case-sensitive. "coffee" is different from "Coffee".

        This method will be called twice in the main function in expenses.py with the same dictionary, but different
        files.

        This method doesnâ€™t return anything.  Rather, it updates the given expenses dictionary based
        on the expenses in the given file.

        For example, after loading the expenses from the file, the expenses dictionary should look like
        this: {'food': Expense('food', 5.00), 'coffee': Expense('coffee', 12.40),
               'rent': Expense('rent', 825.00), 'clothes': Expense('clothes', 45.00),
               'entertainment': Expense('entertainment', 135.62), 'music': Expense('music', 324.00),
               'family': Expense('family', 32.45)}
